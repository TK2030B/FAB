 crownlands.1.d:0 "King Robert went on a hunt outside of Kings Landing in the Kingswood. There he encountered a wild boar, but as he was drinking wine all day he overestimated his abilities and got seriously injured. Back in Kings Landing, the doctors tried everything they could but he sadly passed away the next day.\n\nNow his oldest son Joffrey Baratheon is the next in line to become King of the Seven Kingdoms. However, on Robert Baratheons deathbed, he wished that Ned Stark rules the Seven Kingdoms till Joffrey is old enough."

In order to find out the real heir, we need to act as a regency, as Robert wished, and plan our next steps wisely. As some Lannisters are still in the city, it might be wise to deal with them before they can act against us."

 crownlands.4.d:0 "With Jon Arryn's death, one of the most important positions in all of Westeros has become vacant. Although the King is still in mourning, we must find a suitable replacement in time.\n\nNone of the other lords have a connection to the King like Ned Stark, Warden of the North. They fought side by side during Robert's Rebellion, and he is known as a wise leader. On the other hand, we could also choose Renly Baratheon to strengthen the Baratheons' grip on the Iron Throne. Alternatively, we could select Tywin Lannister, head of the Lannisters, although his personal agenda regarding the Iron Throne is unknown."

 crownlands.7.d:0 "King Robert Baratheon has decided to embark on a hunting expedition, a favored pastime of the monarch. As the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, these excursions offer him a brief respite from the demands of the crown. While the hunt is a routine affair, it temporarily removes the King from the day-to-day governance of the realm. The court continues to function in his absence, but with the King away, the handling of urgent matters may see slight delays until his return."
 crownlands.7.a:0 "Business as usual during the King's retreat"
 crownlands.8.t:0 "The King Announces Two Weeks of Merriment"
 crownlands.8.d:0 "King Robert Baratheon has decided to host a grand feast within the walls of the Red Keep. Nobles and lords from across the Seven Kingdoms have been invited to partake in the revelry, with tables laden with the finest food and drink the realm has to offer. The event is a spectacle of opulence, with musicians, dancers, and entertainers ensuring the night is filled with merriment. The Crownlands have seen an influx of visitors and trade as preparations for the feast bring increased activity to King's Landing. While the lavish celebration boosts morale among the court and commoners alike, it also places a considerable strain on the royal treasury."
 crownlands.8.a:0 "Two costly, but unforgettable weeks"
 crownlands.9.t:0 "The King Tours the Seven Kingdoms"
 crownlands.9.d:0 "King Robert Baratheon has embarked on a grand tour of the Seven Kingdoms, visiting each region to reaffirm his rule and connect with the people. The royal entourage, accompanied by numerous courtiers, knights, and attendants, travels in a display of the crown’s power and presence. While the tour garners favor among the nobility and common folk alike, the extensive journey places considerable demands on local resources and stretches the royal treasury thin."

It's was never a concern for anyone and we simply thought they got lost in the endless snow.\n\nToday a courier brought a message to our camp, stating that some of our northern villages experienced an influx of refugees fleeing from the northernmost lands we know. They talk about 'White Walkers' and that they burned down entire communities, slaughtered their people and what's even crazier, they talk about the living dead, people who were previously their friends and got killed in the chaos started to stand up again and join the enemy forces.\n\nWe don't know the truth of these rumours, but we know something bad happened up there in the north."

It seems whatever happened to the rest will be a mystery forever, as all they could say was 'White Walker' and something about their comrades who joined their ranks now.\n\nAlthought we will probably never find out what happened exactly there, it seems some sort of force is forming in the north, which could pose a threat to us in the future."

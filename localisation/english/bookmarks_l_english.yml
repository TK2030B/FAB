NO1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The North, the largest kingdom in Westeros, remains under the rule of House Stark. Though loyal to the Crown, the North's resourcefulness and military might are tempered by regional divisions. With winter on the horizon, the Stark's resilience may be put to the test."

RI1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Iron Islands, led by House Greyjoy, are a seafaring kingdom with a fierce desire for independence. The Ironborn are notorious raiders, and Balon Greyjoy’s ambition to expand his power could make them a growing threat to the stability of Westeros."

TW1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Lannister controls the wealthiest kingdom in Westeros, fueled by their vast gold mines. With immense political and military influence, the Lannisters’ ambition is rivaled only by their intrigue. Their grip on power, however, is fraught with constant schemes and betrayals."

ST1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Stormlands, ruled by House Baratheon, are the seat of military power in Westeros. Known for their strategic position at Storm’s End, they are led by Robert Baratheon, whose iron-fisted rule keeps the realm in check. But with political unrest brewing, the Baratheons may soon face internal threats."

DA1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dorne, ruled by House Martell, is a proud kingdom seeking revenge against the Lannisters for the murder of Elia Martell. Their isolationist stance is tempered by a simmering desire for vengeance, and Dorne’s wealth and position make them a force that cannot be ignored."

CR1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "King Robert Baratheon rules the Seven Kingdoms, but his grip on power is weakening. With his kingdom plagued by internal strife and factions plotting for control, the Crownlands may soon find itself embroiled in a war for the throne as old loyalties are tested."

FR1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Freys control the crucial crossing of the Red Fork and hold sway over the Riverlands. While Walder Frey remains a master of intrigue, the looming threat of civil war could force him to choose sides in a realm on the verge of chaos."

RE1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Tyrell rules the fertile lands of the Reach, a region rich in agriculture and military power. Though loyal to the crown, the Tyrells find themselves caught between political intrigue and their own ambitions. Their strength in numbers could prove pivotal in the upcoming struggle for dominance."

VA1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Vale, governed by House Arryn, is a highly defensible kingdom nestled in the mountains. Its isolationist tendencies make it less involved in the politics of Westeros, yet its formidable military and strategic location make it a key player in the looming conflicts."

DR1_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen, now serves as the stronghold of Stannis Baratheon. A grim and storm-lashed island, it is home to a hardened garrison and a fleet loyal to its master. Though overlooked by the court at King's Landing, Stannis and his followers simmer with resentment, their loyalty unrewarded. With his brother Robert upon the throne and his younger brother Renly basking in courtly favor, Stannis stands isolated—but his iron will and sense of duty remain unshaken. As the winds of war begin to stir, Dragonstone may yet become the forge of a new claim to the realm."

Game_Event.1.d:0 "First of all, I’d like to extend my deepest thanks to §RRoemer9§!—without him and his *Westeros at War* mod, as well as §RMaestro§! and his *Old Europe 1300* mod, this project would not have been possible.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing this mod as much as I enjoyed making it. It’s still a work in progress, but it’s fully playable and should provide a fun and immersive experience from the beginning to the end of the series.\n\nDon’t forget to §Rjoin the Discord§! to share your feedback, discuss strategies, or just chat with fellow players.\n\nMost importantly—§Rhave fun!§!\n\n§R- TK2030§!"

Game_Event.2.t:0 "Game of Thrones Mode (2/3)"
Game_Event.2.d:0 "Game of Thrones Mode is currently §ROFF§!.\n\nYou're playing with mechanics that closely follow base HOI4, offering a more traditional gameplay experience.\n\nWould you like to enable Game of Thrones Mode? This immersive mode introduces major changes:\n- Dragons are 10× more expensive but also 10× more powerful\n- Additional tweaks to mechanics for a truly Westerosi feel.\n\nRecommendation: Enable this mode for a more epic and thematic experience — or keep it off if you prefer a classic HOI4 base."

Game_Event.4.t:0 "Game of Thrones Mode Chosen"
Game_Event.4.d:0 "§R[FROM.GetName]§! has selected §RGame of Thrones Mode§!. This mode enables immersive mechanics, including powerful but costly §Rdragons§! and heavily fortified §RForts§!, among other adjustments."

Game_Event.8.t:0 "Sandbox Mode (3/3)"
Game_Event.8.d:0 "Sandbox Mode is currently §ROFF§!.\n\nThe Seven Kingdoms are puppets of the Crownlands, ensuring strong centralized control under the Iron Throne. Backstabbing and rebellion are much harder, preserving a more faithful political structure.\n\nWould you like to enable Sandbox Mode? This mode includes:\n- Independent Seven Kingdoms, still pledged to the King but no longer puppets.\n- Greater freedom to act independently — start wars, break allegiances, or forge your own destiny.\n- Additional tweaks for a looser, more sandbox-style experience.\n\nRecommendation:\n- For a lore-accurate playthrough, enable Historical Focuses and keep Sandbox Mode OFF.\n- For multiplayer or chaotic roleplay fun, TURN ON Sandbox Mode for maximum freedom!"

Game_Event.10.t:0 "Sandbox Mode Chosen"
Game_Event.10.d:0 "§R[FROM.GetName]§! has selected §RSandbox Mode§!. In this mode, the Seven Kingdoms are no longer puppets of the Crownlands — they are §Rindependent§! realms, still pledged to the Iron Throne, but free to act on their own. This setup allows for more dynamic wars, rebellions, and political maneuvering, making it ideal for sandbox and roleplay-driven games."

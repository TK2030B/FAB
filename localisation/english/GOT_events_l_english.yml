Game_Event.1.d:0 "First of all, I’d like to extend my deepest thanks to §RRoemer9§!—without him and his *Westeros at War* mod, as well as §RMaestro§! and his *Old Europe 1300* mod, this project would not have been possible.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing this mod as much as I enjoyed making it. It’s still a work in progress, but it’s fully playable and should provide a fun and immersive experience from the beginning to the end of the series.\n\nDon’t forget to §Rjoin the Discord§! to share your feedback, discuss strategies, or just chat with fellow players.\n\nMost importantly—§Rhave fun!§!\n\n§R- TK2030§!"
